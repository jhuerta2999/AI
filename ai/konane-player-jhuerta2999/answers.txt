1. They have the same answer becasue it is the best option for the computer to take in both algorithms, minimax and alpha beta, but the time
limit for test 5 is less becasue here we are testing the same game with the more efficient alpha beta algorithm that allows us to ignore 
certain branches, meaning that it wouldnt take as long as the minimax test

2. Even though the 1/3 of the branches would be pruned, the test with a depth of 7 would take longer becasue of the extra branching factor we have provided it. 
To understand with number we b = 6 and p = 30, b^p = roughly 64,000,000,000,000, now if b was 7 then that means we would need to check roughly 10,000,000,000,000,
7,000,000,000,000 if we actuallya re able to prune a third of them.

3.Now I unfortunately was not able to actually test this out, but and I quote you, "Asuumptions in question 2 are grossly invalid." Now I am not sure if the assumptions 
were grossly poor or grossly good, but I think they are grossly poor. The test would take much longer for the reasons I have mentioned in questions 2, and would probably 
more nodes beacsue we are not guaranteed to actually prune a third of the brances.
