1.  If I were to make a seprate sphere than to the one that has been already created, we would need to create an instance of these
    new sphere and make sure it is not the same as the one that already exists (inst sphere2 sphere)
    and then we wold add the fact about its color to the associated sphere, (color sphere2 yellow)
    But if we were just to simply provide sphere1 with a color we would simply say (color sphere1 yellow)

2.  It would go ahead and say that dog isa mammal because of the associated bindings of animal --isa--> mammal --isa--> dog
