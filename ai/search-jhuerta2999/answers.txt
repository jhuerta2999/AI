1. This is actually the longest route possible based off the algorithm created. Running this problem with the algorithm the problem is expanded
    twice and reaches the the lab via Cannon Hall, Big Ben, and then reachingt he goal which is the lab.

2. Based off test 3 in where we want to get from stagger to CC, if we give Lab an h(n) of 34 the algorithm does not work becasue our test in where
    we check if we have a consistent heuristic lets us know that the test fails becasue the heuristic is not consistent. If we blok this test then
    we can see that the order things pooped from the PQ are different compared to the order when the h(n) is 4, the true value. We may have 
    still gotten the same result but we run the risk of expanding more times than its neccesary and of course we run the risk of actually not 
    finding the optimal path.
